However, the restarting of the machinery or related product or a change in operating conditions may be 
effected by voluntary actuation of a device other than the control device provided for the purpose, on 
condition that this does not lead to a hazardous situation.
For the machinery or related product functioning in automatic mode, the starting of the machinery or related 
product, restarting after a stoppage, or a change in operating conditions may be possible without intervention, provided this does not lead to a hazardous situation.
Where the machinery or related product has several starting control devices and the operators can therefore 
put each other in danger, additional devices shall be fitted to rule out such risks. If safety requires that starting 
and/or stopping shall be performed in a specific sequence, there shall be devices that ensure that these 
operations are performed in the correct order."
22,2023/1230,Machinery Regulation,III,1,2,4,1,"N o r m a l s t o p

The machinery or related product shall be fitted with one or more emergency stop devices to enable actual or 
impending danger to be averted.
The following exceptions apply:
(a) the machinery or related product in which an emergency stop device would not lessen the risk, either 
because it would not reduce the stopping time or because it would not enable the special measures 
required to deal with the risk to be taken;
(b) portable hand-held or hand-guided machinery or related products.
The device shall:
(a) have clearly identifiable, clearly visible and quickly accessible control devices;
(b) stop the hazardous process as quickly as possible, without creating additional risks;
(c) where necessary, trigger or permit the triggering of certain safeguard movements.
Once active operation of the emergency stop device has ceased following a stop command, that command 
shall be sustained by engagement of the emergency stop device until that engagement is specifically overridden; it shall not be possible to engage the device without triggering a stop command; it shall be possible to 
disengage the device only by an appropriate operation, and disengaging the device shall not restart the

also all related equipment, if its continued operation may be dangerous."
26,2023/1230,Machinery Regulation,III,1,2,4,5,"Selection of control or operating modes
The control or operating mode selected shall override all other control or operating modes, with the 
exception of the emergency stop.
If the machinery or related product has been designed and constructed to allow its use in several control or 
operating modes requiring different protective measures and/or work procedures, it shall be fitted with a 
mode selector, which can be locked in each position. Each position of the selector shall be clearly identifiable 
and shall correspond to a single operating or control mode.
The selector may be replaced by another selection method, which restricts the use of certain functions of the 
machinery or related product to certain categories of operator.
If, for certain operations, the machinery or related product shall be able to operate with a guard displaced or 
removed and/or a protective device disabled, the control or operating mode selector shall simultaneously:
(a) disable all other control or operating modes;
(b) permit operation of hazardous functions only by control devices requiring sustained action;
(c) permit the operation of hazardous functions only in reduced risk conditions while preventing hazards 
from linked sequences;
(d) prevent any operation of hazardous functions by voluntary or involuntary action on the machinery’s or 
related product’s sensors.
If these four conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, the control or operating mode selector shall 
activate other protective measures designed and constructed to ensure a safe intervention zone.

The aim of measures taken must be to eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping."
69,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,2,(b),"1.1.2.(b) In selecting the most appropriate methods, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must apply the following principles, in the order given: — eliminate or reduce risks as far as possible (inherently safe machinery design and construction), — take the necessary protective measures in relation to risks that cannot be eliminated, — inform users of the residual risks due to any shortcomings of the protective measures adopted, indicate whether any particular training is required and specify any need to provide personal protective equipment."
70,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,2,(c),"1.1.2.(c) When designing and constructing machinery and when drafting the instructions, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must envisage not only the intended use of the machinery but also any reasonably foreseeable misuse thereof. The machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent abnormal use if such use would engender a risk. Where appropriate, the instructions must draw the user's attention to ways — which experience has shown might occur — in which the machinery should not be used."
71,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,2,(d),1.1.2.(d) Machinery must be designed and constructed to take account of the constraints to which the operator is subject as a result of the necessary or foreseeable use of personal protective equipment.

73,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,3,,"1.1.3. Materials and products The materials used to construct machinery or products used or created during its use must not endanger persons' safety or health. In particular, where fluids are used, machinery must be designed and constructed to prevent risks due to filling, use, recovery or draining."
74,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,4,,"1.1.4. Lighting 
Machinery must be supplied with integral lighting suitable for the operations concerned where the absence thereof is likely to cause a risk despite ambient lighting of normal intensity. Machinery must be designed and constructed so that there is no area of shadow likely to cause nuisance, that there is no irritating dazzle and that there are no dangerous stroboscopic effects on moving parts due to the lighting. Internal parts requiring frequent inspection and adjustment, and maintenance areas must be provided with appropriate lighting."
75,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,5,,"1.1.5. Design of machinery to facilitate its handling Machinery, or each component part thereof, must: — be capable of being handled and transported safely, — be packaged or designed so that it can be stored safely and without damage. During the transportation of the machinery and/or its component parts, there must be no possibility of sudden movements or of hazards due to instability as long as the machinery and/or its component parts are handled in accordance with the instructions. Where the weight, size or shape of machinery or its various component parts prevents them from being moved by hand, the machinery or each component part must: — either be fitted with attachments for lifting gear, or — be designed so that it can be fitted with such attachments, or — be shaped in such a way that standard lifting gear can easily be attached. Where machinery or one of its component parts is to be moved by hand, it must: — either be easily moveable, or — be equipped for picking up and moving safely.

If the machinery is intended to be used in a hazardous environment presenting risks to the health and safety of the operator or if the machinery itself gives rise to a hazardous environment, adequate means must be provided to ensure that the operator has good working conditions and is protected against any foreseeable hazards. Where appropriate, the operating position must be fitted with an adequate cabin designed, constructed and/or equipped to fulfil the above requirements. The exit must allow rapid evacuation. Moreover, when applicable, an emergency exit must be provided in a direction which is different from the usual exit."
78,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,1,8,,"1.1.8. Seating Where appropriate and where the working conditions so permit, work stations constituting an integral part of the machinery must be designed for the installation of seats. If the operator is intended to sit during operation and the operating position is an integral part of the machinery, the seat must be provided with the machinery. The operator's seat must enable him to maintain a stable position. Furthermore, the seat and its distance from the control devices must be capable of being adapted to the operator. If the machinery is subject to vibrations, the seat must be designed and constructed in such a way as to reduce the vibrations transmitted to the operator to the lowest level that is reasonably possible. The seat mountings must withstand all stresses to which they can be subjected. Where there is no floor beneath the feet of the operator, footrests covered with a slip-resistant material must be provided."
79,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,,,1.2. CONTROL SYSTEMS
80,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,1,,"1.2.1. Safety and reliability of control systems Control systems must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising. Above all, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that: — they can withstand the intended operating stresses and external influences, — a fault in the hardware or the software of the control system does not lead to hazardous situations, — errors in the control system logic do not lead to hazardous situations, — reasonably foreseeable human error during operation does not lead to hazardous situations. Particular attention must be given to the following points: — the machinery must not start unexpectedly, — the parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way, where such change may lead to hazardous situations, — the machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the stop command has already been given, — no moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must fall or be ejected, — automatic or manual stopping of the moving parts, whatever they may be, must be unimpeded, — the protective devices must remain fully effective or give a stop command, — the safety-related parts of the control system must apply in a coherent way to the whole of an assembly of machinery and/or partly completed machinery. For cable-less control, an automatic stop must be activated when correct control signals are not received, including loss of communication."
81,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,2,,"1.2.2. Control devices Control devices must be: — clearly visible and identifiable, using pictograms where appropriate, — positioned in such a way as to be safely operated without hesitation or loss of time and without ambiguity, — designed in such a way that the movement of the control device is consistent with its effect, — located outside the danger zones, except where necessary for certain control devices such as an emergency stop or a teach pendant, — positioned in such a way that their operation cannot cause additional risk, — designed or protected in such a way that the desired effect, where a hazard is involved, can only be achieved by a deliberate action, — made in such a way as to withstand foreseeable forces; particular attention must be paid to emergency stop devices liable to be subjected to considerable forces. Where a control device is designed and constructed to perform several different actions, namely where there is no one-to-one correspondence, the action to be performed must be clearly displayed and subject to confirmation, where necessary. Control devices must be so arranged that their layout, travel and resistance to operation are compatible with the action to be performed, taking account of ergonomic principles. Machinery must be fitted with indicators as required for safe operation. The operator must be able to read them from the control position. From each control position, the operator must be able to ensure that no-one is in the danger zones, or the control system must be designed and constructed in such a way that starting is prevented while someone is in the danger zone. If neither of these possibilities is applicable, before the machinery starts, an acoustic and/or visual warning signal must be given. The exposed persons must have time to leave the danger zone or prevent the machinery starting up. If necessary, means must be provided to ensure that the machinery can be controlled only from control positions located in one or more predetermined zones or locations. Where there is more than one control position, the control system must be designed in such a way that the use of one of them precludes the use of the others, except for stop controls and emergency stops. When machinery has two or more operating positions, each position must be provided with all the required control devices without the operators hindering or putting each other into a hazardous situation."
82,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,3,,"1.2.3. Starting It must be possible to start machinery only by voluntary actuation of a control device provided for the purpose. The same requirement applies: — when restarting the machinery after a stoppage, whatever the cause, — when effecting a significant change in the operating conditions. However, the restarting of the machinery or a change in operating conditions may be effected by voluntary actuation of a device other than the control device provided for the purpose, on condition that this does not lead to a hazardous situation. For machinery functioning in automatic mode, the starting of the machinery, restarting after a stoppage, or a change in operating conditions may be possible without intervention, provided this does not lead to a hazardous situation. Where machinery has several starting control devices and the operators can therefore put each other in danger, additional devices must be fitted to rule out such risks. If safety requires that starting and/or stopping must be performed in a specific sequence, there must be devices which ensure that these operations are performed in the correct order."
83,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,4,,1.2.4. Stopping
84,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,4,1,"1.2.4.1. Normal stop Machinery must be fitted with a control device whereby the machinery can be brought safely to a complete stop. Each workstation must be fitted with a control device to stop some or all of the functions of the machinery, depending on the existing hazards, so that the machinery is rendered safe. The machinery's stop control must have priority over the start controls. Once the machinery or its hazardous functions have stopped, the energy supply to the actuators concerned must be cut off."
85,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,4,2,"1.2.4.2. Operational stop Where, for operational reasons, a stop control that does not cut off the energy supply to the actuators is required, the stop condition must be monitored and maintained."
86,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,4,3,"1.2.4.3. Emergency stop Machinery must be fitted with one or more emergency stop devices to enable actual or impending danger to be averted. The following exceptions apply: — machinery in which an emergency stop device would not lessen the risk, either because it would not reduce the stopping time or because it would not enable the special measures required to deal with the risk to be taken, — portable hand-held and/or hand-guided machinery. The device must: — have clearly identifiable, clearly visible and quickly accessible control devices, — stop the hazardous process as quickly as possible, without creating additional risks, — where necessary, trigger or permit the triggering of certain safeguard movements. Once active operation of the emergency stop device has ceased following a stop command, that command must be sustained by engagement of the emergency stop device until that engagement is specifically overridden; it must not be possible to engage the device without triggering a stop command; it must be possible to disengage the device only by an appropriate operation, and disengaging the device must not restart the machinery but only permit restarting. The emergency stop function must be available and operational at all times, regardless of the operating mode. Emergency stop devices must be a back-up to other safeguarding measures and not a substitute for them."
87,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,4,4,"1.2.4.4. Assembly of machinery In the case of machinery or parts of machinery designed to work together, the machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that the stop controls, including the emergency stop devices, can stop not only the machinery itself but also all related equipment, if its continued operation may be dangerous."
88,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,5,,"1.2.5. Selection of control or operating modes The control or operating mode selected must override all other control or operating modes, with the exception of the emergency stop. If machinery has been designed and constructed to allow its use in several control or operating modes requiring different protective measures and/or work procedures, it must be fitted with a mode selector which can be locked in each position. Each position of the selector must be clearly identifiable and must correspond to a single operating or control mode. The selector may be replaced by another selection method which restricts the use of certain functions of the machinery to certain categories of operator. If, for certain operations, the machinery must be able to operate with a guard displaced or removed and/or a protective device disabled, the control or operating mode selector must simultaneously: — disable all other control or operating modes, — permit operation of hazardous functions only by control devices requiring sustained action, — permit the operation of hazardous functions only in reduced risk conditions while preventing hazards from linked sequences, — prevent any operation of hazardous functions by voluntary or involuntary action on the machine's sensors. If these four conditions cannot be fulfilled simultaneously, the control or operating mode selector must activate other protective measures designed and constructed to ensure a safe intervention zone. In addition, the operator must be able to control operation of the parts he is working on from the adjustment point."
89,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,2,6,,"1.2.6. Failure of the power supply The interruption, the re-establishment after an interruption or the fluctuation in whatever manner of the power supply to the machinery must not lead to dangerous situations. Particular attention must be given to the following points: — the machinery must not start unexpectedly, — the parameters of the machinery must not change in an uncontrolled way when such change can lead to hazardous situations, — the machinery must not be prevented from stopping if the command has already been given, — no moving part of the machinery or piece held by the machinery must fall or be ejected, — automatic or manual stopping of the moving parts, whatever they may be, must be unimpeded, — the protective devices must remain fully effective or give a stop command."
90,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,,,1.3. PROTECTION AGAINST MECHANICAL HAZARDS
91,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,1,,"1.3.1. Risk of loss of stability Machinery and its components and fittings must be stable enough to avoid overturning, falling or uncontrolled movements during transportation, assembly, dismantling and any other action involving the machinery. If the shape of the machinery itself or its intended installation does not offer sufficient stability, appropriate means of anchorage must be incorporated and indicated in the instructions."
92,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,2,,"1.3.2. Risk of break-up during operation The various parts of machinery and their linkages must be able to withstand the stresses to which they are subject when used. The durability of the materials used must be adequate for the nature of the working environment foreseen by the manufacturer or his authorised representative, in particular as regards the phenomena of fatigue, ageing, corrosion and abrasion. The instructions must indicate the type and frequency of inspections and maintenance required for safety reasons. They must, where appropriate, indicate the parts subject to wear and the criteria for replacement. Where a risk of rupture or disintegration remains despite the measures taken, the parts concerned must be mounted, positioned and/or guarded in such a way that any fragments will be contained, preventing hazardous situations. Both rigid and flexible pipes carrying fluids, particularly those under high pressure, must be able to withstand the foreseen internal and external stresses and must be firmly attached and/or protected to ensure that no risk is posed by a rupture. Where the material to be processed is fed to the tool automatically, the following conditions must be fulfilled to avoid risks to persons: — when the workpiece comes into contact with the tool, the latter must have attained its normal working condition, — when the tool starts and/or stops (intentionally or accidentally), the feed movement and the tool movement must be coordinated."
93,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,3,,1.3.3. Risks due to falling or ejected objects Precautions must be taken to prevent risks from falling or ejected objects.
94,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,4,,"1.3.4. Risks due to surfaces, edges or angles Insofar as their purpose allows, accessible parts of the machinery must have no sharp edges, no sharp angles and no rough surfaces likely to cause injury."
95,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,5,,"1.3.5. Risks related to combined machinery Where the machinery is intended to carry out several different operations with manual removal of the piece between each operation (combined machinery), it must be designed and constructed in such a way as to enable each element to be used separately without the other elements constituting a risk for exposed persons. For this purpose, it must be possible to start and stop separately any elements that are not protected."
96,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,6,,"1.3.6. Risks related to variations in operating conditions Where the machinery performs operations under different conditions of use, it must be designed and constructed in such a way that selection and adjustment of these conditions can be carried out safely and reliably."
97,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,7,,"1.3.7. Risks related to moving parts The moving parts of machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent risks of contact which could lead to accidents or must, where risks persist, be fitted with guards or protective devices. All necessary steps must be taken to prevent accidental blockage of moving parts involved in the work. In cases where, despite the precautions taken, a blockage is likely to occur, the necessary specific protective devices and tools must, when appropriate, be provided to enable the equipment to be safely unblocked. The instructions and, where possible, a sign on the machinery shall identify these specific protective devices and how they are to be used."
98,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,8,,1.3.8. Choice of protection against risks arising from moving parts Guards or protective devices designed to protect against risks arising from moving parts must be selected on the basis of the type of risk. The following guidelines must be used to help to make the choice.
99,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,1,3,8,1,"1.3.8.1. Moving transmission parts Guards designed to protect persons against the hazards generated by moving transmission parts must be: — either fixed guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.1, or — interlocking movable guards as referred to in section 1.4.2.2. Interlocking movable guards should be used where frequent access is envisaged."

Control devices The driver must be able to actuate all control devices required to operate the machinery from the driving position, except for functions which can be safely actuated only by using control devices located elsewhere. These functions include, in particular, those for which operators other than the driver are responsible or for which the driver has to leave the driving position in order to control them safely. Where there are pedals, they must be so designed, constructed and fitted as to allow safe operation by the driver with the minimum risk of incorrect operation. They must have a slip-resistant surface and be easy to clean. Where their operation can lead to hazards, notably dangerous movements, the control devices, except for those with preset positions, must return to the neutral position as soon as they are released by the operator. In the case of wheeled machinery, the steering system must be designed and constructed in such a way as to reduce the force of sudden movements of the steering wheel or the steering lever caused by shocks to the guide wheels. Any control that locks the differential must be so designed and arranged that it allows the differential to be unlocked when the machinery is moving. The sixth paragraph of section 1.2.2, concerning acoustic and/or visual warning signals, applies only in the case of reversing."

Where, for operating purposes, machinery is fitted with devices which exceed its normal clearance zone (e.g. stabilisers, jib, etc.), the driver must be provided with the means of checking easily, before moving the machinery, that such devices are in a particular position which allows safe movement. This also applies to all other parts which, to allow safe movement, have to be in particular positions, locked if necessary. Where it does not give rise to other risks, movement of the machinery must depend on safe positioning of the aforementioned parts. It must not be possible for unintentional movement of the machinery to occur while the engine is being started."

Travelling function Without prejudice to road traffic regulations, self-propelled machinery and its trailers must meet the requirements for slowing down, stopping, braking and immobilisation so as to ensure safety under all the operating, load, speed, ground and gradient conditions allowed for. The driver must be able to slow down and stop self-propelled machinery by means of a main device. Where safety so requires, in the event of a failure of the main device, or in the absence of the energy supply needed to actuate the main device, an emergency device with a fully independent and easily accessible control device must be provided for slowing down and stopping. Where safety so requires, a parking device must be provided to render stationary machinery immobile. This device may be combined with one of the devices referred to in the second paragraph, provided that it is purely mechanical. Remote-controlled machinery must be equipped with devices for stopping operation automatically and immediately and for preventing potentially dangerous operation in the following situations: — if the driver loses control, — if it receives a stop signal, — if a fault is detected in a safety-related part of the system, — if no validation signal is detected within a specified time. Section 1.2.4 does not apply to the travelling function."

Movement of pedestrian-controlled machinery Movement of pedestrian-controlled self-propelled machinery must be possible only through sustained action on the relevant control device by the driver. In particular, it must not be possible for movement to occur while the engine is being started. The control systems for pedestrian-controlled machinery must be designed in such a way as to minimise the risks arising from inadvertent movement of the machine towards the driver, in particular: — crushing, — injury from rotating tools. The speed of travel of the machinery must be compatible with the pace of a driver on foot. In the case of machinery on which a rotary tool may be fitted, it must not be possible to actuate the tool when the reverse control is engaged, except where the movement of the machinery results from movement of the tool. In the latter case, the reversing speed must be such that it does not endanger the driver."

Transmission of power between self-propelled machinery (or tractor) and recipient machinery Removable mechanical transmission devices linking self-propelled machinery (or a tractor) to the first fixed bearing of recipient machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way that any part that moves during operation is protected over its whole length. On the side of the self-propelled machinery (or tractor), the power take-off to which the removable mechanical transmission device is attached must be protected either by a guard fixed and linked to the self-propelled machinery (or tractor) or by any other device offering equivalent protection. It must be possible to open this guard for access to the removable transmission device. Once it is in place, there must be enough room to prevent the drive shaft damaging the guard when the machinery (or the tractor) is moving. On the recipient machinery side, the input shaft must be enclosed in a protective casing fixed to the machinery. Torque limiters or freewheels may be fitted to universal joint transmissions only on the side adjoining the driven machinery. The removable mechanical transmission device must be marked accordingly. All recipient machinery, the operation of which requires a removable mechanical transmission device to connect it to self-propelled machinery (or a tractor), must have a system for attaching the removable mechanical transmission device so that, when the machinery is uncoupled, the removable mechanical transmission device and its guard are not damaged by contact with the ground or part of the machinery. The outside parts of the guard must be so designed, constructed and arranged that they cannot turn with the removable mechanical transmission device. The guard must cover the transmission to the ends of the inner jaws in the case of simple universal joints and at least to the centre of the outer joint or joints in the case of wide-angle universal joints. If means of access to working positions are provided near to the removable mechanical transmission device, they must be designed and constructed in such a way that the shaft guards cannot be used as steps, unless designed and constructed for that purpose."

Without prejudice to the provisions of road traffic regulations, machinery with a ride-on driver must have the following equipment: — an acoustic warning device to alert persons, — a system of light signals relevant to the intended conditions of use; the latter requirement does not apply to machinery intended solely for underground working and having no electrical power, — where necessary, there must be an appropriate connection between a trailer and the machinery for the operation of signals. Remote-controlled machinery which, under normal conditions of use, exposes persons to the risk of impact or crushing must be fitted with appropriate means to signal its movements or with means to protect persons against such risks. The same applies to machinery which involves, when in use, the constant repetition of a forward and backward movement on a single axis where the area to the rear of the machine is not directly visible to the driver. Machinery must be constructed in such a way that the warning and signalling devices cannot be disabled unintentionally. Where it is essential for safety, such devices must be provided with the means to check that they are in good working order and their failure must be made apparent to the operator. Where the movement of machinery or its tools is particularly hazardous, signs on the machinery must be provided to warn against approaching the machinery while it is working; the signs must be legible at a sufficient distance to ensure the safety of persons who have to be in the vicinity."

Where this value does not exceed 2,5 m/s2, this must be mentioned, — the highest root mean square value of weighted acceleration to which the whole body is subjected, if it exceeds 0,5 m/s2. Where this value does not exceed 0,5 m/s2, this must be mentioned, — the uncertainty of measurement. These values must be either those actually measured for the machinery in question or those established on the basis of measurements taken for technically comparable machinery which is representative of the machinery to be produced. Where harmonised standards are not applied, the vibration must be measured using the most appropriate measurement code for the machinery concerned. The operating conditions during measurement and the measurement codes used must be described."

(d) ‘Test coefficient’ means the arithmetic ratio between the load used to carry out the static or dynamic tests on lifting machinery or a lifting accessory and the maximum working load marked on the lifting machinery or lifting accessory. (e) ‘Static test’ means the test during which lifting machinery or a lifting accessory is first inspected and subjected to a force corresponding to the maximum working load multiplied by the appropriate static test coefficient and then re-inspected once the said load has been released to ensure that no damage has occurred. (f) ‘Dynamic test’ means the test during which lifting machinery is operated in all its possible configurations at the maximum working load multiplied by the appropriate dynamic test coefficient with account being taken of the dynamic behaviour of the lifting machinery in order to check that it functions properly.

Mechanical strength Machinery, lifting accessories and their components must be capable of withstanding the stresses to which they are subjected, both in and, where applicable, out of use, under the installation and operating conditions provided for and in all relevant configurations, with due regard, where appropriate, to the effects of atmospheric factors and forces exerted by persons. This requirement must also be satisfied during transport, assembly and dismantling. Machinery and lifting accessories must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent failure from fatigue and wear, taking due account of their intended use. The materials used must be chosen on the basis of the intended working environments, with particular regard to corrosion, abrasion, impacts, extreme temperatures, fatigue, brittleness and ageing. Machinery and lifting accessories must be designed and constructed in such a way as to withstand the overload in the static tests without permanent deformation or patent defect. Strength calculations must take account of the value of the static test coefficient chosen to guarantee an adequate level of safety. That coefficient has, as a general rule, the following values: (a) manually-operated machinery and lifting accessories: 1,5; (b) other machinery: 1,25. Machinery must be designed and constructed in such a way as to undergo, without failure, the dynamic tests carried out using the maximum working load multiplied by the dynamic test coefficient. This dynamic test coefficient is chosen so as to guarantee an adequate level of safety: the coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 1,1. As a general rule, the tests will be performed at the nominal speeds provided for. Should the control circuit of the machinery allow for a number of simultaneous movements, the tests must be carried out under the least favourable conditions, as a general rule by combining the movements concerned."

Drums and wheels must be designed, constructed and installed in such a way that the ropes or chains with which they are equipped can be wound without coming off. Ropes used directly for lifting or supporting the load must not include any splicing other than at their ends. Splicings are, however, tolerated in installations which are intended by design to be modified regularly according to needs of use. Complete ropes and their endings must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety. As a general rule, this coefficient is equal to 5. Lifting chains must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety. As a general rule, this coefficient is equal to 4. In order to verify that an adequate working coefficient has been attained, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of chain and rope used directly for lifting the load and for the rope ends, perform the appropriate tests or have such tests performed."

Ropes must not comprise any splices or loops other than at their ends; (b) where chains with welded links are used, they must be of the short-link type. The working coefficient of chains must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; this coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 4; (c) the working coefficient for textile ropes or slings is dependent on the material, method of manufacture, dimensions and use. This coefficient must be chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; it is, as a general rule, equal to 7, provided the materials used are shown to be of very good quality and the method of manufacture is appropriate to the intended use. Should this not be the case, the coefficient is, as a general rule, set at a higher level in order to secure an equivalent level of safety. Textile ropes and slings must not include any knots, connections or splicing other than at the ends of the sling, except in the case of an endless sling; (d) all metallic components making up, or used with, a sling must have a working coefficient chosen in such a way as to guarantee an adequate level of safety; this coefficient is, as a general rule, equal to 4; (e) the maximum working load of a multilegged sling is determined on the basis of the working coefficient of the weakest leg, the number of legs and a reduction factor which depends on the slinging configuration; (f) in order to verify that an adequate working coefficient has been attained, the manufacturer or his authorised representative must, for each type of component referred to in (a), (b), (c) and (d), perform the appropriate tests or have such tests performed."

222,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,1,1,,"6.1.1. Mechanical strength The carrier, including any trapdoors, must be designed and constructed in such a way as to offer the space and strength corresponding to the maximum number of persons permitted on the carrier and the maximum working load. The working coefficients for components set out in sections 4.1.2.4 and 4.1.2.5 are inadequate for machinery intended for the lifting of persons and must, as a general rule, be doubled. Machinery intended for lifting persons or persons and goods must be fitted with a suspension or supporting system for the carrier designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure an adequate overall level of safety and to prevent the risk of the carrier falling. If ropes or chains are used to suspend the carrier, as a general rule, at least two independent ropes or chains are required, each with its own anchorage."
223,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,1,2,,"6.1.2. Loading control for machinery moved by power other than human strength The requirements of section 4.2.2 apply regardless of the maximum working load and overturning moment, unless the manufacturer can demonstrate that there is no risk of overloading or overturning."
224,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,2,,,"6.2. CONTROL DEVICES Where safety requirements do not impose other solutions, the carrier must, as a general rule, be designed and constructed in such a way that persons in the carrier have means of controlling upward and downward movements and, if appropriate, other movements of the carrier. In operation, those control devices must override any other devices controlling the same movement with the exception of emergency stop devices. The control devices for these movements must be of the hold-to-run type except where the carrier itself is completely enclosed."
225,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,3,,,6.3. RISKS TO PERSONS IN OR ON THE CARRIER
226,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,3,1,,"6.3.1. Risks due to movements of the carrier Machinery for lifting persons must be designed, constructed or equipped in such a way that the acceleration or deceleration of the carrier does not engender risks for persons."
227,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,3,2,,"6.3.2. Risk of persons falling from the carrier The carrier must not tilt to an extent which creates a risk of the occupants falling, including when the machinery and carrier are moving. Where the carrier is designed as a work station, provision must be made to ensure stability and to prevent hazardous movements. If the measures referred to in section 1.5.15 are not adequate, carriers must be fitted with a sufficient number of suitable anchorage points for the number of persons permitted on the carrier. The anchorage points must be strong enough for the use of personal protective equipment against falls from a height. Any trapdoor in floors or ceilings or side doors must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent inadvertent opening and must open in a direction that obviates any risk of falling, should they open unexpectedly."
228,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,3,3,,"6.3.3. Risk due to objects falling on the carrier Where there is a risk of objects falling on the carrier and endangering persons, the carrier must be equipped with a protective roof."

230,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,4,1,,"6.4.1. Risks to persons in or on the carrier The carrier must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent risks due to contact between persons and/or objects in or on the carrier with any fixed or moving elements. Where necessary in order to fulfil this requirement, the carrier itself must be completely enclosed with doors fitted with an interlocking device that prevents hazardous movements of the carrier unless the doors are closed. The doors must remain closed if the carrier stops between landings where there is a risk of falling from the carrier. The machinery must be designed, constructed and, where necessary, equipped with devices in such a way as to prevent uncontrolled upward or downward movement of the carrier. These devices must be able to stop the carrier at its maximum working load and at the foreseeable maximum speed. The stopping action must not cause deceleration harmful to the occupants, whatever the load conditions."
231,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,4,2,,"6.4.2. Controls at landings Controls, other than those for emergency use, at landings must not initiate movements of the carrier when: — the control devices in the carrier are being operated, — the carrier is not at a landing."
232,2006/42/EC,Machinery Directive,I,6,4,3,,"6.4.3. Access to the carrier The guards at the landings and on the carrier must be designed and constructed in such a way as to ensure safe transfer to and from the carrier, taking into consideration the foreseeable range of goods and persons to be lifted."
